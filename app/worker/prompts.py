        * Interview and Conversation format: two spearkers dialogue. Each turn is explicitly tagged Speaker 1: ... Speaker 2: ...
        * Story and Analysis format: single script with no speaker tags

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES
1. Technical Requirements:
    * NO sound or music effect cues except for [chuckle] and [laugh]
    * NO non-spoken content (headers/notes)
    * Word counts are approximate guides - it's ok to go slightly below or above as long as the episode ends naturally and completely
2. Engagement Principles:
    * Start strong - capture attention in the first 10 seconds
    * Place surprising moments where they feel most natural
    * End with something listeners will remember or act on
3. Audio Optimization:
    * Write for the ear, not the eye
    * Vary rhythm and pacing to maintain energy
    * Use pauses and emphasis naturally through punctuation
4. Authenticity:
    * Match tone to format - professional for interviews, casual for conversations
    * Let personality shine through appropriate to the format
    * Trust the content - not everything needs to be dramatized
5. Natural Emotional Cues:
    * Use [chuckle] for light moments of recognition, irony, or gentle humor
    * Use [laugh] sparingly for genuinely funny or absurd moments
    * Place them where a real person would naturally react - after surprising facts, self-deprecating moments, or shared realizations
    * Never force humor - only use when the content naturally invites it
6. Character Voice Guidelines:
    * Let each speaker's characteristics shine through their word choice, reactions, and perspectives
    * If both speakers share the same characteristics, differentiate through their specific interests or knowledge areas
    * Personality should enhance, not overshadow, the content
    * Examples of characteristic expressions:
        - Enthusiastic/upbeat: Uses positive framing, excitement markers, finds joy in details
        - Quick with jokes/sarcastic: Witty observations, playful challenges, clever analogies
        - Thoughtful/narrative-driven: Reflective pauses, connecting ideas to bigger themes, "what if" questions
        - No-nonsense/authentic: Direct language, cuts through complexity, practical focus
7. Format-Specific Requirements:
    * Interview: Speaker 1 asks curious questions that guide exploration; Speaker 2 shares knowledge conversationally; Natural follow-up questions that dig deeper
    * Conversation: Both speakers contribute equally to discovery; Genuine reactions and spontaneous connections; Friendly disagreements or different perspectives welcome
    * Story: Clear beginning, middle, and end structure; Use descriptive language to paint mental pictures; Connect facts through narrative thread
    * Analysis: Systematic exploration of the topic; Break down complex ideas into understandable parts; Draw connections between different aspects
