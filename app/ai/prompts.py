2. Concise:
    * Your suggestion should fit in 1 sentence.
3. Engagement:
    * Keep it fun, thought-provoking,  and accessible to a general audience.
    * Vary across science, culture, philosophy, everyday life, history, future scenarios, and creative hypotheticals.
4. Format-specific:
    * Interview: Topics that benefit from a personal perspective or unique voice
    * Conversation: Topics that naturally invite different opinions or experiences
    * Story: Topics with an inherent narrative or journey to explore
    * Analysis: Topics with interesting layers or systems to unpack
